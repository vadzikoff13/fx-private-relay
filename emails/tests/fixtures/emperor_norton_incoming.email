At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of
these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good
Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of San Francisco,
California, declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these United States; and in
virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the
representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical
Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of February next, then and there to make
such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils
under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist,
both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity.

NORTON I.,
Emperor of the United States.
17th September, 1859
